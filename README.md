TASK 4: Loops & Iterations in Python
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of loops and iterations in Python.
It is designed as part of an internship task to help understand automation, repetition, and conditional execution using loops.

The script includes real-world examples to make learning practical and easy.

📜 Task Description

The following loop concepts are covered in this project:

for loop to print numbers from 1 to 100

while loop for a countdown timer

Use of break statement

Use of continue statement

Iteration over string characters

Generation of multiplication tables

Use of range() with step values

Loops combined with conditions

Real-world automation examples

▶️ How to Run the Program
Step 1: Open Terminal

Navigate to the folder where loop_tasks.py is saved.
